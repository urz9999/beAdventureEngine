# beAdventurous Engine
a simple yet powerful engine for pojnt &amp; click adventures written in pure javascript.

beAdventurous Engine uses JSON maps to define interactions between objects in the scenes, 
so no coding is required to make a simple game.

To have a better understanding of the engine, please take a look to the documentation provided 
alongside the source code.

will also work on online documentation soon.

The engine as also a demo project inside.

# About the assets
To make a simple demo project and to speedup development I used many graphical resources I found on the Internet.
I'll try to give proper credit here for every resource I'm able to. 
If I've missed some, please, help me correct this.
This is a didactical, fun and hopefully useful project and none of these resources 
were used with any commercial intent.
